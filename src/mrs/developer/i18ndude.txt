mrsd i18ndude
=============

The mrsd i18ndude command helps you to buildout your .pot and .po files
using the i18ndude.

Requirements
------------

It's required to have i18ndude somewhere installed on your machine. There
are several place where it will be searched:

- If mrsd is root, the it will be searched in the bin/ directory of the
  buildout where mrsd is rooted.
- It will be searched using `which` and `whereis`
- Finally it is searched in the directory where mrsd is installed. So you
  may just add it to the buildout where you install `mrs.developer`.

Usage
-----

There are two modes using the command:

Building the .pot files:

Run `mrsd i18ndude --build` to build the .pot-files within the locales
directory of the package you are currently in (pwd).

Syncing the .pot and .po files:

Running `mrsd i18ndude --sync` will sync the .pot files the .po file of
every language currently existing. For creating a new language just use
the `--languages` option.

Changing the domain
-------------------

The default domain name is taken from the package name. If your package's
name is `foo.bar` the your domain will also be `foo.bar`. You may change
the domain with the `--domain` option, but keep in mind that it cause
trouble to use multiple domains in the same package.
